\title{Read a BLAST .tsv files}
\usage{
read_blast(file, col_spec = "std")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data
(either a single string or a raw vector).

Files ending in \code{.gz}, \code{.bz2}, \code{.xz}, or \code{.zip} will
be automatically uncompressed. Files starting with \verb{http://},
\verb{https://}, \verb{ftp://}, or \verb{ftps://} will be automatically
downloaded. Remote gz files can also be automatically downloaded and
decompressed.

Literal data is most useful for examples and tests. To be recognised as
literal data, the input must be either wrapped with \code{I()}, be a string
containing at least one new line, or be a vector containing at least one
string with a new line.

Using a value of \code{\link[readr:clipboard]{clipboard()}} will read from the system clipboard.}

\item{col_spec}{BLAST custom column specifiers}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Read a BLAST output in `-outfmt 6/7` format (o6/o7). If BLAST was run
with custom column specifiers, those have to be passed to the call.
}
\details{
Uses "# " to identify and ignore comment lines in o7. NOTE that any line
containing this string anywhere, not limited to the line start will be
trimmed after the "# ".
}
